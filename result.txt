the old man drank his coffee slowly it was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it for a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch he had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day the boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff feeling the pebbled sand under their feet and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water good luck old man good luck the old man said he fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water he began to row out of the harbour in the dark there were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see th em now the moon was below the hills sometimes someone would speak in a boat but most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars they spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish the old man knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean he saw the phosphorescence of the gulf weed in the water a s he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the floor of the ocean here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them in the dark the old man cou ld feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing th at their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness he was very fond of flying fish as they were his princ ipal friends on the ocean he was sorry for the birds especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying an d looking and almost never finding and he thought the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds an d the heavy strong ones why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so crue l she is kind and very beautiful but she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly dipping and hu nting with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea he always thought of the sea as la mar which is wh at people call her in spanish when they love her sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman some of the younger fishermen those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had mot orboats bought when the shark livers had brought much money spoke of her as el mar which is masculine they spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy but the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them the moon affects her as it does a woman he thought he was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his spee d and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current he was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour i worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing he thought today i ll work out where the schools of bonito and albacor e are and maybe there will be a big one with them before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current one bait was down forty fathoms the second was at seventy five and the third and fourth were down in the blu e water at one hundred and one hundred and twenty five fathoms each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook insid e the bait fish tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook the curve and the point was covered with fr esh sardines each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half garland on the projecting steel there wa s no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was not sweet smelling and good tasting the boy had given him t wo fresh small tunas or albacores which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets and on the others he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness each line as thick around as a big pencil was looped onto a green sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that if it were necessary a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up a nd down and at their proper depths it was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise the sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats low on the water and well in toward the shore spread out across the curre nt then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water and then as it rose clear the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it he looked down into the water and watched the lines th at went straight down into the dark of the water he kept them straighter than anyone did so that at each level in the da rkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundr ed but he thought i keep them with precision only i have no luck any more but who knows maybe today every day is a new d ay it is better to be lucky but i would rather be exact then when luck comes you are ready the sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the east there were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore all my life the early sun has hurt my eyes he thought yet they are still good in the evening i can look straight into it without getting the blackness it has more force in the evening too but in the morning it is pa inful just then he saw a man of war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him he made a quick drop slanting down on his back swept wings and then circled again he s got something the old man said aloud he s not just lo oking he rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling he did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down but he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fi shed if he was not trying to use the bird the bird went higher in the air and circled again his wings motionless then he dove suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface dolphin the old man said aloud big dolphin he shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow it had a wire leader and a medium sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines he let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of the bow he went back to rowing and to watching the long winged black bird who was working now low over the water as he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish the old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish the dolphin were cuttin g through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water driving at speed when the fish dropped it is a big school of dolphin he thought they are widespread and the flying fish have little chance the bird has no chance the flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast he watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineff ectual movements of the bird that school has gotten away from me he thought they are moving out too fast and too far but perhaps i will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them my big fish must be somewhere the clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it the water was a dark blue now so dark that it was almost purple as he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in th e dark water and the strange light the sun made now he watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish the strange light the sun made in the water now that the sun was higher meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land but the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow sun bleached sargasso weed and t he purple formalized iridescent gelatinous bladder of a portuguese man of war floating dose beside the boat it turned on its side and then righted itself it floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing a yar d behind it in the water agua mala the man said you whore from where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down in to the water and saw the tiny fish that were coloured like the trailing filaments and swam between them and under the sm all shade the bubble made as it drifted they were immune to its poison but men were not and when same of the filaments w ould catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man was working a fish he would have welts and sores on his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or poison oak can give but these poisonings from the agua mala came qu ickly and struck like a whiplash the iridescent bubbles were beautiful but they were the falsest thing in the sea and th e old man loved to see the big sea turtles eating them the turtles saw them approached them from the front then shut the ir eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and all the old man loved to see the turtles eat them a nd he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet he loved green turtles and hawk bills with their elegance and speed and their great value and he had a friendl y contempt for the huge stupid loggerheads yellow in their armour plating strange in their love making and happily eatin g the portuguese men of war with their eyes shut he had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years he was sorry for them all even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton mos t people are heartless about turtles because a turtle s heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered but the old man thought i have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs he ate the white eggs to give him self strength he ate them all through may to be strong in september and october for the truly big fish he also drank a c up of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of the fishermen kept their gear it was there f or all fishermen who wanted it most fishermen hated the taste but it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again he s found fish he said aloud no flying fish broke the surface and there was no scatter ing of bait fish but as the old man watched a small tuna rose in the air turned and dropped head first into the water th e tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumpi ng in all directions churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait they were circling it and driving it if they don t travel too fast i will get into them the old man thought and he watched the school working the water white a nd the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait fish that were forced to the surface in their panic the bird is a gre at help the old man said just then the stern line came taut under his foot where he had kept a loop of the line and he d ropped his oars and felt tile weight of the small tuna s shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul i t in the shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side and into the boat he lay in the stern in the sun compact and bullet shaped his big unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering stro kes of his neat fast moving tail the old man hit him on the head for kindness and kicked him his body still shuddering u nder the shade of the

o say can you see by the dawns early light what so proudly we hailed at the twilights last gleaming whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight oer the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming and the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air gave proof through the night that our flag was still there o say does that star spangled banner yet wave oer the land of the free and the home of the brave on the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep where the foes haughty host in dread silence reposes what is that which the breeze oer the towering steep as it fitfully blows half conceals half discloses now it catches the gleam of the mornings first beam in full glory reflected now shines in the stream tis the starspangled banner o long may it wave oer the land of the free and the home of the brave and where is that band who so vauntingly swore that the havoc of war and the battles confusion a home and a country should leave us no more their blood has washed out their foul footsteps pollution no refuge could save the hireling and slave from the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave and the starspangled banner in triumph doth wave oer the land of the free and the home of the brave o thus be it ever when freemen shall stand between their loved homes and the wars desolation blest with victry and peace may the heavenrescued land praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation then conquer we must when our cause it is just and this be our motto in god is our trust and the starspangled banner in triumph shall wave oer the land of the free and the home of the brave
